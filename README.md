# bps_avr

This repository contains reusable code i have written while learning AVR development. It currently consists of:

* __driver/sr7seg.*__ 7 segment display driver built upon my 74HC595 driver
* __driver/sr74hc595.*__ code for writing into a 74HC595 shift register with configurable output pins
* __util/bits.h__ utility macros for bit manipulation
